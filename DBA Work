DBA Tasks:

Switchover/Failover: The DBA will initiate either a planned switchover or an unplanned failover to transition the standby database into the new primary role.

Ensure minimal downtime: During switchover, the new primary (previous standby) is brought online and becomes active with minimal interruption. Failover would happen automatically if the old primary fails unexpectedly.

Business Outcome:

The new primary is functional, and the old primary becomes the standby database.

Estimated downtime: Typically 1-2 hours for the switchover/failover operation.

3. Post-Switchover/Failover Configuration (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)
DBA Tasks:

Reconfigure Data Guard: Update Data Guard configurations to ensure that log transport and log apply services are functional between the new primary and standby.

Configure archive destinations: Ensure that archive logs are correctly being sent to the new standby database.

Monitor recovery processes: Verify that the standby is properly receiving and applying logs from the new primary.

Enable Data Guard Broker (if used): Ensure the Data Guard Broker is configured for easy management of the RAC nodes and standby systems.

Business Outcome:

The standby database is synchronized with the new primary.

Data Guard is fully operational for both RAC nodes in the new setup.

Estimated downtime: Typically minimal (<1 hour) during this phase, as operations mostly happen in the background.

4. Decommission Old Primary Configuration (Estimated Time: 1 Day)
DBA Tasks:

Remove old primary from Data Guard: Remove the old primary database from the Data Guard configuration to avoid outdated configurations.

Archive log destination cleanup: Clean up any references to the old primary database on both the new primary and standby.

Clusterware decommission: If applicable, remove the old RAC node from the cluster.

Business Outcome:

The old primary is no longer part of the Data Guard configuration, and the standby remains functional and synchronized.

Estimated downtime: No downtime, but minimal background maintenance tasks may require brief periods of database activity.

5. Post-Migration Monitoring and Final Validation (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)
DBA Tasks:

Monitor: Perform detailed monitoring to ensure the new RAC nodes are functioning correctly, both from the perspective of Data Guard synchronization and RAC cluster performance.

Validate log shipping and apply processes: Ensure the standby is fully synchronized with the new primary.

Test failover/switched-over scenarios: Run tests to ensure that Data Guard's failover and switchover processes work smoothly, maintaining high availability.

Performance tuning and adjustments: If required, DBA may make adjustments to optimize performance.

Business Outcome:

The new primary and standby are stable, synchronized, and running optimally.

Estimated downtime: No downtime, as the system is continuously monitored and optimized.

Total Estimated DBA Work Timeframe: 5-7 Days
Key Business Takeaways:
High Availability & Disaster Recovery: The migration ensures that both the primary and standby databases are highly available, with automatic failover in case of any unexpected failure, ensuring business continuity.

Minimal Disruption: The switchover/failover happens with minimal downtime (typically 1-2 hours), ensuring the business continues to operate without major interruptions.

Seamless Transition: The migration involves a phased approach where the old primary is decommissioned, and the new RAC + Data Guard configuration is fully functional with minimal downtime.

Long-Term Stability: Post-migration, the new RAC setup with Data Guard ensures a more stable and scalable infrastructure for high availability and disaster recovery.

By following this structured migration plan, the DBA ensures a smooth transition to the new 2-node RAC with Data Guard, aligning with business needs for uptime, disaster recovery, and minimal service interruption.

Migrating an Oracle 19c 2-node RAC with a standby database to a new RAC server involves several steps. The process typically includes configuring Data Guard for the standby database, setting up the new RAC environment, and performing a switchover or failover.

Below is the detailed step-by-step process with commands:

âœ… Overview
Source Database: Oracle 19c 2-node RAC (Primary Database) with a Standby (Physical Standby Database).

Target Database: New Oracle 19c 2-node RAC (Primary Database) with Standby (Physical Standby Database).

Toolset: Oracle Data Guard, RMAN, Oracle Clusterware.

ðŸ§° Pre-Migration Steps
ðŸ”¹ 1. Backup the Existing RAC Databases (Primary + Standby)
Backup the primary and standby databases to ensure you have a consistent backup.

bash
Copy
Edit
rman target / nocatalog
BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
ðŸ”¹ 2. Prepare the Target Database (RAC 2-node with Standby)
Set up the new 2-node RAC cluster with Oracle Grid Infrastructure, Oracle RAC, and Data Guard.

Install Oracle Grid Infrastructure (GI) and Oracle RAC software on the new servers.

Ensure ASM disk groups are set up and match the configuration from the original cluster.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Create the Standby Database Initialization Parameters
On the target system, create the standby initialization parameters file:

bash
Copy
Edit
-- On the target primary node, create the initialization file.
create pfile='/tmp/initTARGETDB.ora' from spfile;
Manually edit the file to configure the following parameters for the standby:

ini
Copy
Edit
db_name=TARGETDB
db_unique_name=TARGETDB_NEW
log_file_name_convert='+DATA/TARGETDB/', '+DATA/TARGETDB_NEW/'
db_file_name_convert='+DATA/TARGETDB/', '+DATA/TARGETDB_NEW/'
fal_server=TARGETDB
fal_client=TARGETDB_NEW
log_archive_config='DG_CONFIG=(TARGETDB, TARGETDB_NEW)'
log_archive_dest_2='SERVICE=TARGETDB_NEW LGWR ASYNC VALID_FOR=(ONLINE_LOGFILES,PRIMARY_ROLE) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=TARGETDB_NEW'
Create a password file on both RAC nodes of the target cluster:

bash
Copy
Edit
orapwd file=$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapwTARGETDB_NEW password=oracle format=12
ðŸ”¹ 4. Verify Network Configuration (TNS, Scan, and DNS)
Ensure SCAN (Single Client Access Name) and listener configurations are set up on both source and target databases. This step ensures that both primary and standby instances can communicate correctly.

TNS Configuration Example:

ini
Copy
Edit
TARGETDB =
  (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=target-scan)(PORT=1521))
  (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=TARGETDB)))

TARGETDB_NEW =
  (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=target-scan)(PORT=1521))
  (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=TARGETDB_NEW)))
Test the connectivity:

bash
Copy
Edit
tnsping TARGETDB_NEW
ðŸ§° RMAN Duplicate Standby Database (Active Duplicate)
ðŸ”¹ 5. RMAN Duplicate for Standby Setup (Target Database)
On the target system, you can use RMAN to create an Active Duplicate of the source database.

Run RMAN on the target (standby) node:

bash
Copy
Edit
rman target sys/oracle@TARGETDB auxiliary sys/oracle@TARGETDB_NEW
Inside RMAN:

rman
Copy
Edit
DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE 
FOR STANDBY 
FROM ACTIVE DATABASE 
DORECOVER
SPFILE
  SET DB_UNIQUE_NAME='TARGETDB_NEW'
  SET DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT='+DATA/TARGETDB/', '+DATA/TARGETDB_NEW/'
  SET LOG_FILE_NAME_CONVERT='+DATA/TARGETDB/', '+DATA/TARGETDB_NEW/'
  SET CONTROL_FILES='+DATA/TARGETDB_NEW/control01.ctl','+FRA/PRODDBNEW/control02.ctl'
  SET FAL_CLIENT='TARGETDB_NEW'
  SET FAL_SERVER='TARGETDB'
  SET LOG_ARCHIVE_CONFIG='DG_CONFIG=(TARGETDB, TARGETDB_NEW)'
  SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1='LOCATION=USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST VALID_FOR=(ALL_LOGFILES,ALL_ROLES) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=TARGETDB_NEW'
  SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2='SERVICE=TARGETDB LGWR ASYNC VALID_FOR=(ONLINE_LOGFILES,PRIMARY_ROLE) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=TARGETDB'
  SET DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST='+FRA'
  SET DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE='100G';
ðŸ”¹ 6. Verify Standby Configuration
On the target system (standby), ensure that the data files, logs, and ASM disk groups are created correctly and that the database is mounted.

bash
Copy
Edit
sqlplus / as sysdba
startup mount;
Check that the standby database has the correct redo apply status:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT process, status FROM v$managed_standby;
ðŸ§° Data Guard Broker Configuration
ðŸ”¹ 7. Configure Data Guard Broker
On the Primary and Standby nodes, enable Data Guard Broker:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- On Primary (TARGETDB)
alter system set dg_broker_start=true scope=both sid='*';

-- On Standby (TARGETDB_NEW)
alter system set dg_broker_start=true scope=both sid='*';
ðŸ”¹ 8. Create the Data Guard Configuration
Now, use Data Guard Broker (dgmgrl) to create the configuration:

bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle@TARGETDB
CREATE CONFIGURATION dgconf AS PRIMARY DATABASE IS TARGETDB CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS TARGETDB;

ADD DATABASE TARGETDB_NEW AS CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS TARGETDB_NEW MAINTAINED AS PHYSICAL;

ENABLE CONFIGURATION;
ðŸ”¹ 9. Perform a Switchover or Failover
After ensuring the Data Guard configuration is functional, perform a switchover (recommended) or failover (if the primary is down).

Performing a Switchover:
bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle
SWITCHOVER TO TARGETDB_NEW;
This will transition the TARGETDB database to a standby role and TARGETDB_NEW to the primary role.

Failover (If Switchover is not possible):
bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle
FAILOVER TO TARGETDB_NEW;
ðŸ”¹ 10. Final Verification
Once the switchover or failover is successful, perform the following checks:

Verify Database Role:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT database_role FROM v$database;
Verify Log Apply Status:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT process, status FROM v$managed_standby;
Ensure Data Guard Broker is enabled and operational:

bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle
SHOW CONFIGURATION;
Ensure Clusterware is functioning properly:

bash
Copy
Edit
crsctl stat res -t
Verify RAC Instances:

bash
Copy
Edit
srvctl status database -d TARGETDB_NEW
ðŸ”¹ 11. Reconfigure Oracle Clusterware and RAC Instances
Once the migration is complete, reconfigure Oracle Clusterware for the new database:

bash
Copy
Edit
-- Register new DB with Clusterware
srvctl add database -d TARGETDB_NEW -o $ORACLE_HOME -p '+DATA/TARGETDB_NEW/spfileTARGETDB_NEW.ora' -r PRIMARY -n TARGETDB_NEW

-- Add instances for each node
srvctl add instance -d TARGETDB_NEW -i TARGETDB_NEW1 -n racnode1
srvctl add instance -d TARGETDB_NEW -i TARGETDB_NEW2 -n racnode2

-- Start the database
srvctl start database -d TARGETDB_NEW
ðŸ§° Post-Migration Validation Checks
After the migration, perform post-migration checks to ensure everything is running smoothly:

Verify Database Open Mode:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT open_mode, database_role FROM v$database;
Validate Redo Log Apply:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT process, status FROM v$managed_standby;
Check ASM disk groups and data files:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM v$asm_diskgroup;
Perform end-to-end application testing to ensure there is no degradation in performance.

âœ… Conclusion
You have successfully migrated your Oracle 19c 2-node RAC with a standby database to new servers using Data Guard and RMAN. The critical aspects are ensuring that Data Guard is configured correctly, performing a switchover/failover, and verifying that the new environment is stable before going live.

how to remove dg info from old prim after switchover / failover


ChatGPT said:
After performing a switchover or failover in an Oracle Data Guard configuration, it is important to clean up the old primary (now in the standby role) and remove any Data Guard configuration information from it. Here are the steps you need to follow to remove Data Guard information from the old primary after a successful switchover or failover.

Steps to Remove Data Guard Information from the Old Primary Database:
1. Ensure Data Guard Broker is Disabled on the Old Primary (Now Standby)
First, ensure that the Data Guard Broker is disabled on the old primary database (which is now in the standby role). You can do this by running the following command on the old primary node:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Log in to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA on the old primary (now standby)
sqlplus / as sysdba

-- Disable Data Guard Broker
ALTER SYSTEM SET dg_broker_start=FALSE SCOPE=SPFILE;
This will disable the Data Guard Broker on the old primary, which is now functioning as the standby database.

2. Remove the Old Primary Database from the Data Guard Configuration
Next, use Data Guard Broker (dgmgrl) to remove the old primary database (now standby) from the Data Guard configuration.

bash
Copy
Edit
-- Log in to Data Guard Broker as SYSDBA
dgmgrl sys/oracle@new_primary

-- Show the current Data Guard configuration
SHOW CONFIGURATION;

-- Remove the old primary database (now standby)
REMOVE DATABASE 'old_primary_db';
This command removes the old primary database from the Data Guard configuration.

3. Remove Data Guard Redo Transport Configuration on the New Primary
On the new primary database, you will need to disable the transport of logs to the old primary (now in the standby role).

sql
Copy
Edit
-- On the new primary database, run this to disable the transport of logs to the old primary
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2='' SCOPE=SPFILE;
This will remove the log archive destination pointing to the old primary database.

4. Remove Data Guard Information from the tnsnames.ora and listener.ora
You should also clean up the old Data Guard-related entries in the tnsnames.ora and listener.ora files, which were used to connect to the old primary database.

In tnsnames.ora: Remove the old primary database (which is now a standby) from the configuration.

Example:

ini
Copy
Edit
# Remove the old primary database entry (old_primary_db) from the tnsnames.ora
old_primary_db =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = old_primary_host)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = old_primary_service)
    )
  )
In listener.ora: Remove any entries related to the old primary database.

Example:

ini
Copy
Edit
# Remove the old primary listener entry from listener.ora
LISTENER_OLD_PRIMARY =
  (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = old_primary_host)(PORT = 1521))
5. Remove Data Guard Configuration from the Old Primary Database (Standby)
On the old primary database (now standby), you should manually clean up any Data Guard-related configurations, such as archive log destinations.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- On the old primary (now standby), clean up archive log destinations
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1='' SCOPE=SPFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2='' SCOPE=SPFILE;
This removes the configuration for log shipping to the old primary from the standby (which is now the old primary).

6. Optional: Remove the Standby Redo Logs if No Longer Needed
If you no longer need the standby redo logs on the old primary (now standby), you can drop them from the system:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- On the old primary (now standby), drop the standby redo logs
ALTER DATABASE DROP STANDBY LOGFILE GROUP <group_number>;
Replace <group_number> with the actual redo log group number if needed.

7. Remove Old Primary Database from Oracle Clusterware (If Applicable)
If the old primary database was registered with Oracle Clusterware, remove it from Clusterware as well.

bash
Copy
Edit
-- Use the following command to remove the old primary database from Oracle Clusterware
srvctl remove database -d old_primary_db

-- If the old primary had instances registered, remove them as well
srvctl remove instance -d old_primary_db -i old_primary_db1 -n old_primary_host
srvctl remove instance -d old_primary_db -i old_primary_db2 -n old_primary_host
8. Remove Oracle Data Guard Configuration Files
If no longer needed, you can also clean up the Data Guard configuration files (such as dataguard logs and configuration files) from both the old and new primary systems. This is an optional cleanup step.

Final Verification
After performing all the steps above, perform the following checks:

Verify Data Guard Configuration:

bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle@new_primary
SHOW CONFIGURATION;
Ensure Data Guard Broker is Disabled on the old primary (now standby):

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT dg_broker_start FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'dg_broker_start';
Check Archive Log Destinations to verify that no unwanted destinations remain:

sql
Copy
Edit
SHOW PARAMETER log_archive_dest;
Verify Database Role:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT database_role FROM v$database;
This should now show STANDBY on the old primary (now standby) and PRIMARY on the new primary.

By following these steps, you will successfully remove the Data Guard configuration from the old primary database after a switchover or failover.

You said:
once the swithover / failover happen do we need to configur standby for this new primary


ChatGPT said:
Yes, once the switchover or failover occurs, and your new primary is in place, you will need to configure the standby database (if applicable) for the new primary. In the case of a failover, the standby database automatically becomes the new primary, but you'll still need to perform some configuration changes to re-enable Data Guard operations, particularly if you want to reestablish a new physical standby or if you need to configure Data Guard Broker.

Steps to Reconfigure Standby for the New Primary Database:
1. Verify Database Role of the New Primary
After the switchover or failover, verify that the new database is indeed the primary database.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- On the new primary database
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;
This should show PRIMARY.

2. Configure the Standby for the New Primary (If New Standby is Needed)
If you need to configure a new standby database for the newly promoted primary database, you'll need to:

Ensure the standby is properly set up with a matching initialization parameter file (pfile).

Configure log transport services to send redo logs from the new primary to the standby.

Enable Data Guard to maintain synchronization between the new primary and the standby.

3. Ensure Archive Log Configuration Is Correct
On the new primary database, check and configure the archive log destinations to include the correct destination for the new standby.

On New Primary:
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Ensure that the new primary is configured to send logs to the standby
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2='SERVICE=standby_db VALID_FOR=(ONLINE_LOGFILES,PRIMARY_ROLE) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=standby_db' SCOPE=SPFILE;

-- You can also set up the FAL (Fetch Archive Log) configuration for the new standby
ALTER SYSTEM SET FAL_SERVER='standby_db' SCOPE=SPFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM SET FAL_CLIENT='new_primary_db' SCOPE=SPFILE;
These configurations ensure that archive logs are sent to the new standby and that the FAL (Fetch Archive Log) client-server configuration is correctly set up.

4. Configure Data Guard Broker (Optional)
If you are using Data Guard Broker and want to re-enable it for the new primary database, you'll need to:

Enable the Data Guard Broker on both the new primary and the standby databases.

Recreate the Data Guard configuration with the new primary and standby databases.

Enable Data Guard Broker:
sql
Copy
Edit
-- On the new primary database
ALTER SYSTEM SET dg_broker_start=TRUE SCOPE=SPFILE;

-- On the standby database
ALTER SYSTEM SET dg_broker_start=TRUE SCOPE=SPFILE;
Create the Data Guard Configuration:
bash
Copy
Edit
-- Log in to Data Guard Broker on the new primary
dgmgrl sys/oracle@new_primary_db

-- Create a new Data Guard configuration
CREATE CONFIGURATION new_dg_config AS PRIMARY DATABASE IS new_primary_db CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS new_primary_db;

-- Add the standby database to the configuration
ADD DATABASE standby_db AS CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS standby_db MAINTAINED AS PHYSICAL;

-- Enable the Data Guard configuration
ENABLE CONFIGURATION;
5. Configure Standby Database (Physical)
If your previous standby was in the physical standby role and needs to be reconfigured to synchronize with the new primary, perform the following steps:

On the Standby Database (now in the standby role for the new primary):
Create the Standby Initialization Parameters (on the standby):

Ensure the db_unique_name, log_file_name_convert, and db_file_name_convert parameters are set to match the new primary and its data file locations.

Configure the standby redo logs.

Start Recovery on the Standby Database:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- On the standby, start recovery process to begin applying logs from the new primary
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE DISCONNECT;
Check Log Apply Status:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT process, status FROM v$managed_standby;
This should show the managed recovery process (MRP) applying logs from the new primary.

6. Verify Data Guard Synchronization
After the configuration, ensure that both databases (new primary and new standby) are synchronized:

On the New Primary:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT database_role FROM v$database;
SELECT log_mode FROM v$database;
On the Standby:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT process, status FROM v$managed_standby;
7. Perform Additional Cleanup (Optional)
Once the new primary and standby are fully synchronized, you may want to clean up the old Data Guard configuration:

Remove Old Primary Database from Data Guard:

bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle@new_primary_db
REMOVE DATABASE 'old_primary_db';
Remove any old archive destinations or configurations pointing to the old database.

8. Testing Failover/Switchover Again (Optional)
After completing the configuration of the new standby database, you can perform a manual failover or switchover to test that everything works as expected.

Switchover to Test:

bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle@new_primary_db
SWITCHOVER TO standby_db;
Failover to Test:

bash
Copy
Edit
dgmgrl sys/oracle@new_primary_db
FAILOVER TO standby_db;
Final Considerations
After a switchover or failover, your new primary should be able to accept read-write operations, and the standby should be able to apply logs from it.

Always monitor the Data Guard configuration and log shipping to ensure that the new primary and standby remain in sync.

Monitoring: The DBA will monitor the health of both the new primary and standby databases for any issues such as lag or replication delays.

Verify Log Shipping: Ensure archive logs are being shipped and applied correctly.

Test Failover/Switchover: As a best practice, the DBA may test the switchover/failover process again to ensure everything works as expected and that the standby is ready to become the primary if needed.

Final Optimization: Any performance tuning or troubleshooting will be handled at this stage.

Business Outcome:

The system is stable, and business operations continue without any disruption.

Estimated Downtime: No downtime, but continuous monitoring will ensure the system is operating optimally.

Total Estimated DBA Work Timeframe: 5-7 Days
Overall Business Impact:
High Availability: With the new primary and standby databases in place, your business benefits from improved disaster recovery and high availability.

Minimal Disruption: The migration process is designed to minimize downtime, with most operations completed during off-peak hours.

Smooth Transition: The migration and reconfiguration are done in phases, with a clear focus on ensuring business continuity and data integrity at each step.

Key Business Takeaway:
The migration process from the old primary to the new primary, along with standby reconfiguration, will take approximately 5-7 days.
