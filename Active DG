Perfect! Here's a complete step-by-step guide for manual and DGMGRL-based switchover and failover in an Oracle 2-node RAC with Active Data Guard configuration.

üîß ASSUMPTIONS:
Primary DB: PRIMDB (2-node RAC)

Standby DB: STBYDB (2-node RAC with Active Data Guard)

Data Guard Broker is configured

TNS entries configured for both

You have sys/sysdba access

‚úÖ I. CHECK ENVIRONMENT
sql
Copy
Edit
-- On both PRIMARY and STANDBY
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE, OPEN_MODE, PROTECTION_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;
SELECT NAME, VALUE FROM V$PARAMETER WHERE NAME LIKE '%db_unique_name%';
üîÑ II. SWITCHOVER
1. üíª Manual Switchover Steps
üÖ∞Ô∏è On Primary (PRIMDB):
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Check readiness
SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;

-- Begin switchover
ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PHYSICAL STANDBY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;

-- Shutdown and mount as standby
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP MOUNT;
üÖ±Ô∏è On Standby (STBYDB):
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Begin switchover to primary
ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY;

-- Open the new primary
ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
üÖ∞Ô∏è Back to Primary (now standby):
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Start MRP on new standby
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;
2. üöÄ DGMGRL-Based Switchover
bash
Copy
Edit
-- Connect to broker
DGMGRL sys/password@PRIMDB

-- Check configuration
SHOW CONFIGURATION;
SHOW DATABASE VERBOSE PRIMDB;
SHOW DATABASE VERBOSE STBYDB;

-- Perform switchover
SWITCHOVER TO STBYDB;

-- Exit and confirm
SHOW CONFIGURATION;
‚ö†Ô∏è III. FAILOVER
1. üíª Manual Failover Steps (when PRIMDB is unrecoverable)
üÖ±Ô∏è On Standby (STBYDB):
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Convert standby to primary
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE FINISH;

-- Activate standby
ALTER DATABASE ACTIVATE STANDBY DATABASE;

-- Open it
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP;
Note: Original Primary cannot be reinstated unless it's re-cloned.

2. üöÄ DGMGRL-Based Failover
bash
Copy
Edit
-- Connect to broker
DGMGRL sys/password@STBYDB

-- Perform failover
FAILOVER TO STBYDB;

-- Check config
SHOW CONFIGURATION;
Optionally, use IMMEDIATE if you want to skip applying logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
FAILOVER TO STBYDB IMMEDIATE;
üîÅ IV. REINSTATE FAILED PRIMARY (if possible)
Only in DGMGRL:

bash
Copy
Edit
-- Reinstate primary (after failover)
REINSTATE DATABASE PRIMDB;
Ensure PRIMDB is shutdown cleanly and ready in MOUNT state before doing this.

üß∞ USEFUL QUERIES
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Check apply lag
SELECT NAME, VALUE, TIME_COMPUTED FROM V$DATAGUARD_STATS;

-- Check real-time apply
SELECT PROCESS, STATUS, THREAD#, SEQUENCE# FROM V$MANAGED_STANDBY;

-- Log gap
SELECT * FROM V$ARCHIVE_GAP;
üìù NOTES:
Ensure dg_broker_start = TRUE in both DBs.

Switchover is safe & planned, failover is for disaster.

RAC does not change how switchover/failover works in terms of commands.

In RAC, you only need to connect via one node.

Would you like a bash script version or automation with cron + shell + SQL*Plus for this too?
